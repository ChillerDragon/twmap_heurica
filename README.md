# twmap_heurica

Plan is to use heuristics to find specific layers in a map so they can be processed automatically.
For example find a freeze layer:
 - Based on the color and tile set used.
 - Based on the overlap with the freeze in the game layer.
 - Base on the layer name.

The same approach should be doable for hookable and unhook.
